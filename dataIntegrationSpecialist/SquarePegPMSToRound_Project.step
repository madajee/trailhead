STEP 5: Synchronize PMS Project data from Square Peg's PMS external system to Round Salesforce Org.

Req 1: Round will have to expose a REST interface for PMS to send the project data.

Req 2: Project is a child of Opportunity, so the Rest service have to update the opportunity delivery status record and then create / update  a project record with Inbound data.

Solution:
a) Develop a Porject Restful Service with Resource (/project/) and use @HttpPost to annotate the postProjectData method of ProjectRESTService.

b) Opportunity ID will be passed as a parameter along with other project data, so look up the opportunity record.

c) Update the Delivery Status on the opportunity & create the project record associating with the opportunity.
